# Double-Team-Demo

This is the executable and necessary files to play the demo for Double Team, a puzzle-patformer where you control 2 characters with the same input. The game is made using C++/SDL2. The game requires a 64 bit computer and Windows OS. Below is a link to a full playthrough that you can watch if you cant get the game to run, but I strongly reccomend just playing the game if possible, as the video naturally spoils the puzzle solutions.
